/**
 * Persistent store for discovered stealth addresses (owned by this recipient).
 * Uses Zustand with encrypted localStorage persistence via Web Crypto AES-GCM.
 * Master private keys are NEVER stored here. Data is passphrase-derived encrypted.
 *
 * Threat model: protects against localStorage read-only access (XSS
 * exfiltration, browser extensions). Does NOT protect against:
 * - XSS that captures the passphrase at entry time
 * - Runtime memory inspection while data is decrypted
 * - Compromised browser extensions with full DOM access
 *
 * Encryption: AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2-derived key (600k iterations).
 * The passphrase is held in memory only via securitySettingsStore.
