# Running The ASP

The Association Set Provider keeps the privacy pool withdrawable by publishing roots. It reads public pool events, applies a policy, rebuilds Merkle trees, and posts roots to Soroban.

For the MVP demo, an ASP is already running on testnet and approving all deposits. Run your own ASP when testing operator flows, custom policy, or production-style infrastructure.

## What The ASP Publishes

| Root | Source | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ASP root | Approved deposit labels after policy screening. | Lets a withdrawer prove their deposit is in the approved association set. |
| State root | Public deposit commitments and withdrawal remainder commitments. | Lets a withdrawer prove membership in the current pool state. |

The ASP cannot move user funds. It only publishes roots. The privacy-pool contract still verifies proofs, nullifiers, and custody.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Node.js 20+ | Required for TypeScript tooling. |
| Repository checkout | The ASP reads `deployments/v1/testnet.json` from the repo. |
| Funded ASP authority | The demo uses the pool admin key to publish roots. |
| Soroban RPC URL | Defaults to the testnet RPC unless overridden. |

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/collinsadi/opaque-stellar.git
cd opaque-stellar/asp
npm ci
```

## Configure

Create an environment file outside git:

```bash
nano ~/.opaque-asp.env
chmod 600 ~/.opaque-asp.env
```

Example:

```bash
ASP_SECRET=S...your_asp_authority_secret...
STELLAR_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org
ASP_INTERVAL_MS=15000
ASP_CONFIRMATIONS=1
ASP_MAX_ROOT_AGE_MS=120000
```

`ASP_SECRET` must be able to call `update_asp_root` and `update_state_root` for the deployed privacy pool.

`ASP_MAX_ROOT_AGE_MS` is the max age of the last published root before the built-in
`PublicationMonitor` fires a stale-root alert (logged as `[ALERT] ...`) and `/health`
(see below) starts reporting unhealthy. A ledger reorg is handled separately by the
built-in `ReorgGuard`, which halts publication (logged as `[REORG] ...`) instead of
publishing a root built on a rolled-back ledger — no configuration needed.

## Run One Tick

```bash
cd ~/stellar/asp
set -a
source ~/.opaque-asp.env
set +a
npm run indexer:once
```

Healthy output looks like:

```text
approved=8 (+1) asp=0x1724c7a6e034... stateLeaves=11 ASP_PUBLISHED STATE_PUBLISHED
```

If there is no new work, it should print `in-sync`.

## Run Continuously

```bash
cd ~/stellar/asp
set -a
source ~/.opaque-asp.env
set +a
npm run indexer
```

The default loop interval is 15 seconds.

## HTTP Server (health, metrics, manifest)

`npm run serve` runs the same reconcile loop plus a minimal HTTP listener:

| Endpoint    | Purpose                                                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/health`   | `200` when the last tick succeeded and the root is fresh; `503` otherwise.      |
| `/metrics`  | Prometheus exposition format (tick duration, publication lag, failure counters). |
| `/manifest` | The current association-set manifest.                                          |

Bind host/port/CORS: `ASP_HTTP_HOST` (default `127.0.0.1`), `ASP_HTTP_PORT` (default
`8791`), `ASP_CORS_ORIGIN` (default `*`).

## systemd Service

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Opaque Stellar ASP indexer

Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple

```

Start it:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable opaque-asp
sudo systemctl start opaque-asp
sudo journalctl -u opaque-asp -f
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Set ASP_SECRET` | Missing authority secret. | Export `ASP_SECRET` or set it in the environment file. |
| `update_asp_root not confirmed` | RPC lag, fee issue, or transaction timeout. | Let the loop retry. If repeated, check authority funding and RPC health. |
| Frontend says roots do not cover deposit | The ASP has not published a root including that deposit yet. | Wait for a tick with `ASP_PUBLISHED STATE_PUBLISHED`, then retry withdrawal. |
| `in-sync` but frontend still fails | Frontend may be reading a different manifest, RPC, or pool deployment. | Compare `deployments/v1/testnet.json`, frontend env, and ASP logs. |
| Very slow catch-up | Fresh ASP state is rebuilding from chain events. | Let it complete or copy `asp/data/` from a trusted running instance. |

## Security Notes

Treat `ASP_SECRET` as a hot admin key. Store it with `chmod 600`, run under a dedicated Linux user, and never commit it. For production, replace approve-all with a documented policy and operational review process.

## Network and Policy Selection

Set `OPAQUE_NETWORK=testnet` or `OPAQUE_NETWORK=mainnet` before starting the ASP. The service loads `deployments/v1/<network>.json`, uses that manifest's `networkPassphrase`, and fails fast if the selected manifest has not deployed `privacyPool` yet. Mainnet is intentionally blocked until the mainnet manifest is populated.

`ASP_POLICY=approveAll` keeps the demo policy. `ASP_POLICY=allowlist` enables operator-managed inclusion; provide comma/newline-separated indices directly in `ASP_ALLOWLIST_INDICES` or point that variable at a local allowlist file. Deposits absent from the allowlist are excluded from the association set and recorded in `data/state/<poolId>.json` under `rejectedIndices` for audit and appeals.

The tick loop backs off after failures with `ASP_MAX_BACKOFF_MS` as the cap. `/health` and `/metrics` expose `consecutiveFailures` / `asp_consecutive_failures`; alerts fire after `ASP_FAILURE_ALERT_THRESHOLD` sustained failures and reset after a successful tick.

ASP logs are JSON objects with `ts`, `level`, `service`, `correlationId`, and event-specific fields. Secrets, passphrases, tokens, signatures, and 32-byte hex values are redacted before emission.
